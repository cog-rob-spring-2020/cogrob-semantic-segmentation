Charles' TODOs:
1) Figure out a way to downsample images before constructing point clouds
2) Integrate Shangjie's approach: ask Shangjie to change code to accept (X, Y, Z)
    and arbitrary angle
3) Pipeline: For each waypoint in trajectory:
    - Translate point cloud to waypoint origin (rotating would be expensive)
    - Use Shangjie's code to find distance to collision at each waypoint
    - Extract earliest distance to collision, report this as the warning
